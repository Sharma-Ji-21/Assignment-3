# 🎲 Dicee App – Creative Use of setState()

## ❗ Note
This app is **not based on the official assignment instructions**. It is a **custom and creative project** that showcases an interactive use of `setState()` in a dice-rolling scenario.

---

## ✅ Key Features

- **Interactive Dice**  
  Two dice (left and right) that can be tapped independently. Each tap triggers a random number (1–6) and rolls the dice image.

- **Dynamic Counter**  
  The counter increases with each dice tap, tracking total interactions.

- **Reset Functionality**  
  A reset icon allows the user to set the counter back to zero.

- **Gesture-Based Updates**  
  Each dice tap is handled separately using `GestureDetector`, and updates are managed via `setState()`.

---

## 🌀 How setState() is Used

- Updates the dice image with a new random number.
- Increments the interaction counter.
- Resets the counter when the reset button is tapped.
